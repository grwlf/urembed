  Converts a set of FILES into the Ur/Web modules. Each Module will contain
  following functions:

    val binary : unit -> transaction blob
    val blobpage : unit -> transaction page
    val text : unit -> transaction string

  The master project (specified with -o FILE.urp) will contain a dictionary
  version of those functions taking the datatype key as an argument, instead of
  unit. Additionally, FFI interfaces will be provided for JavaScript files (see
  the manual for details). Note, in order to actually compile the binaries, you
  have to call
    make -f FILE.mk CC=.. LD=.. UR_INCLUDE_DIR=.. urp
  Where FILE.mk is the Makefile, generated by urembed.

    Example: urembed -o static/Static.urp Style.css Script.js
             make -C static -f Static.mk CC=gcc LD=ld UR_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/urweb urp

  Note: output directory should exist
